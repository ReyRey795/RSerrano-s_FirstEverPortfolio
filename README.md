# RSerrano-s_FirstEverPortfolio
This is an experimental portfolio created by Rey Serrano.

Below you will find an assignment designated for the second week of the UTSA BootCamp.
On the top left corner of the page you will find a navigation bar that jumps to the selcted area in the page.
On the right you will see a set of links at the top and bottom which will open a new tab upon clicking each individual link.
There are several sections that you will see upon opening the page. You will see the about/goals section, a Work section, a personal army picture of myself, and finally a contact info. section.
The media queries are a bit rough, still haven't mastered that, however, they are set.
The website title has also been changed.
