    <h2>About Rey and his goals!</h2>
    <p>
        I am striving to be a Full Stack Web Devoloper, who one day will work for one of the top tech companies known universally such as Google or 
        even Rackspace. I work as a Field Service Manager for Wisenbaker Builder Services, however, currently I am enrolled in a UTSA Coding
        Bootcamp. This bootcamp has already given me the tools to create functional websites such as the one you are currently viewing, so I want
        to personally thank you and your time. I am twenty-four years old, and only getting older so I am taking the first step by learning all I 
        can in this bootcamp, if you have any pointers to give feel free to send me a message at my personal email below in my contact info.
    </p>
