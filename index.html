    <h2>About Rey and his goals!</h2>
    <p>
        Hello my dear reader! First off I wanna thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about little Ol' me. 
        
        <br>

        <br>
        
        Anyways, my name is Reynaldo Junior Serrano, however, I go by Rey for short. It's much easier to pronounce, and I feel like it's just better
        to say instead of "Reynaldo". I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. I was in the army from 2016 to 2017. Unfortunately, I got injured
        and this retired my army career relatively quickly. Although it was brief, I am not ashamed of my time in the military. I was honorably
        discharged and my experience there made me into who I am now. So that is the reason for my personal photo on this page.
        
        <br> 

        <br> 

        I am striving to be a Full Stack Web Devoloper, who one day will work for one of the top tech companies known universally such as Google or 
        even Rackspace. I work as a Field Service Manager for Wisenbaker Builder Services, however, currently I am enrolled in a UTSA Coding
        Bootcamp. This bootcamp has already given me the tools to create functional websites such as the one you are currently viewing, so I want
        to personally thank you and your time. I am twenty-four years old, and only getting older so I am taking the first step by learning all I 
        can in this bootcamp, if you have any pointers to give feel free to send me a message at my personal email below in my contact info.
        
    </p>
